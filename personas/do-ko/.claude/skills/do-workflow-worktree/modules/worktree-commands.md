## Quick Reference (30 seconds)

Command Categories:
- Creation: new - Create isolated worktree
- Navigation: list, switch, go - Browse and navigate
- Management: sync, remove, clean - Maintain worktrees
- Status: status - Check worktree state
- Configuration: config - Manage settings

Quick Start:
1. Create worktree: do-worktree new SPEC-001 "User Authentication"
2. Switch to worktree: do-worktree switch SPEC-001
3. Or use shell eval: eval $(do-worktree go SPEC-001)

## Creation Commands

### do-worktree new - Create Worktree

Create a new isolated Git worktree for SPEC development.

Syntax: do-worktree new <spec-id> [description] [options]

Arguments:
- spec-id: SPEC identifier (e.g., SPEC-001, SPEC-AUTH-001)
- description: Optional description for the worktree

Options:
- --branch <name>: Create specific branch instead of auto-generated
- --base <branch>: Base branch for new worktree (default: main)
- --template <name>: Use predefined template
- --shallow: Create shallow clone for faster setup
- --depth <number>: Clone depth for shallow clone
- --force: Force creation even if worktree exists

Examples:
- Basic creation: do-worktree new SPEC-001 "User Auth System"
- Custom branch: do-worktree new SPEC-002 "Payment" --branch feature/payment-gateway
- From develop: do-worktree new SPEC-003 "API Refactor" --base develop
- With template: do-worktree new SPEC-004 "Frontend" --template frontend
- Fast creation: do-worktree new SPEC-005 "Bug Fixes" --shallow --depth 1

Auto-Generated Branch Pattern:
- Format: feature/SPEC-{ID}-{description-kebab-case}
- Example: SPEC-001 becomes feature/SPEC-001-user-authentication

## Management Commands

### do-worktree sync - Synchronize Worktree

Synchronize worktree with its base branch.

Syntax: do-worktree sync <spec-id> [options]

Arguments:
- spec-id: Worktree identifier (or --all for all worktrees)

- Interactive: do-worktree sync SPEC-001 --interactive
- Preview: do-worktree sync SPEC-001 --dry-run
- Include pattern: do-worktree sync SPEC-001 --include "src/"
- Exclude pattern: do-worktree sync SPEC-001 --exclude "node_modules/"

Conflict Resolution:
When conflicts detected, choose from:
1. Keep worktree version
2. Accept base branch version
3. Open merge tool
4. Skip file
5. Abort sync

### do-worktree remove - Remove Worktree

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Operations

Sync all active worktrees:
- Use shell loop with list --format json and jq to extract IDs
- Run sync for each ID in sequence or parallel

Clean all merged worktrees:
- do-worktree clean --merged-only --force

Create worktrees from SPEC list:
- Read SPEC IDs from file
- Run new command for each

### Shell Aliases

Recommended aliases for .bashrc or .zshrc:
- mw: Short for do-worktree
- mwl: List worktrees
- mws: Switch to worktree
- mwg: Navigate with eval pattern
- mwsync: Sync current worktree
- mwclean: Clean merged worktrees

### Git Hooks Integration

Post-checkout hook actions:
- Detect worktree environment
- Update last access time in registry
- Check if sync needed with base branch
- Load worktree-specific environment

Pre-push hook actions:
